This placeholder file is here as a convenience. You only need to use it if
you change the <appearance> or <element> configuration structure of the
[CONTENTTYPE] content type. In most cases, you don't need to use it.

For example, if you only add new <style> and <attribute> nodes to existing
<element> nodes in [CONTENTTYPELC].xml, you do not need to use this file
because you are not changing the <appearance> or <element> structure of
the [CONTENTTYPE] configuration. You are only adding additional properties.

However, if you add new <appearance> or <element> nodes to the [CONTENTTYPELC].xml
config file, you ARE changing the structure. In such cases, you need to use this
file to override the native template and reflect the additional content
from the new <element> nodes. Using this file is also required if you happen
to change the names of the existing <element> nodes in [CONTENTTYPELC].xml,
which you should avoid. :)
